# Atomodoro Atom package

Atomodoro is a tool for managing work sessions on atom. The number of work intervals and time spent working and taking breaks is fully customizable. Once activated for a session, Atomodoro will run in the background and let you know when it's time to take a break, with a full screen message which obscures your window and prevents you from typing.
