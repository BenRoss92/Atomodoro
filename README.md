# Pompomodoro Atom package

Pompomodoro is a tool for managing work sessions on atom. The number of work intervals and time spent working and taking breaks is fully customizable. Once activated for a session, Pompomodoro will run in the background and let you know when it's time to take a break, with a full screen message which obscures your window and prevents you from typing.

Or via the menu.

Breaks can also be overridden via the atom tool bar.
